# LINQ (Language Integrated Query) Overview

## Definition
- LINQ: Language Integrated Query
- Integrates querying capabilities directly into the C# language

## Origins and Comparison to SQL
- Inspired by SQL's Data Query Language (DQL)
- SQL uses statements (SELECT, WHERE, etc.)
- LINQ implements similar concepts as C# extension methods

## Key Features
- Over 40 LINQ extension methods
- Categorized into 13 categories
- Common operators: Select, Where, OrderBy, GroupBy, Join, aggregate functions

## Implementation
- Extension methods for collections implementing IEnumerable interface
- Methods defined in the Enumerable class
- Often referred to as "LINQ Operators"

## Usage Scenarios
1. Database Querying:
   - Direct SQL Server: Use SQL queries
   - ORM (e.g., Entity Framework): Use LINQ (can map to various databases)
2. In-Memory Collections:
   - Useful for querying lists, arrays, hash sets, etc.

## Advantages
- Uniform querying across different data sources
- Strong typing and IDE support
- Often more readable than complex SQL queries
- Flexible across data sources

## Example
```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
foreach (var number in evenNumbers)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

This overview provides a concise summary of LINQ, its relationship to SQL, key features, implementation details, usage scenarios, advantages, and a basic example.
